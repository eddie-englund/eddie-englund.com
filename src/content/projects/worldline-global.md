AccountIQ is an automated reconciliation platform/solution owned by WorldLine global.
Traditional manual reconciliation of transactions is a time-consuming, costly, and monthly task (at the end of the start of the month).
All of which causes high workloads during short periods. To alleviate this AccountIQ was created to do this in an automated fashion.
However, this is not the only solution AccountIQ provides. However, it is its flagship product/solution.

## My duties and achievements in the project

In the AccountIQ team my primary duty is to work on sprint tasks
such as, updating visual interfaces after I design based on requirements,
creating new provider integrations,
upgrade the systems, maintaining our server, and much more.
My most recent and proud feat is doing a major upgrade on our
Vue 2 front-end application which had 5+ year old dependencies,
build tools such as Webpack 2 (current is 5), and doing a major
overhaul of the interfaces to create a better user experience,
but also to upgrade the developer experience by adding support
for TypeScript, and tooling such as proper Eslint and Prettier.

## AccountIQ consists of the following

- Main backoffice (web app)
- Sales website (web app)
- Documentation portal (web app)
- Several back-end services in Scala (Play-framework and ZIO)

## Some of technologies used

- ZIO
- Cats effects/IO
- PostgresDB
- ElasticSearch
- Akka Actors
- VueJs (2 & 3)
- Vuex
- Pinia
- Typescript

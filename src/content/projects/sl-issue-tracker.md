The SL issue tracker is a personal project that developed as I was, and am very frustrated with the public transport situation in Stockholm.
The trains and busses are inconsistent, late or leaves early, incompetent drivers, IT systems not working as expected and much more.

## The Sl Issue Tracker consists of the following

- Web app
- Back-end application

## Some technologies used

- TypeScript
- Vue 3
- ExpressJs
- PostgresDB
- MikroOrm
- Docker
